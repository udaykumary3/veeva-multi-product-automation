## ⚙️ Configuration

- `config.properties` should be in `src/main/resources` under `automation-framework`:
  ```properties
  browser=chrome
  headless=false
  incognito=false
  ```

---

## 📌 How It Works

- **Driver Management**: Thread-safe `DriverManager`.
- **Config Management**: `ConfigReader` loads `config.properties`.
- **BasePage**: Common Selenium page utilities.
- **Hooks**: Cucumber hooks for setup, teardown, screenshots.
- **Step Definitions**: Defined in `core-product-tests` and use `automation-framework` base classes.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Java 11+
- Maven 3.6+
- Chrome browser
- Allure CLI (for generating reports):  
  👉 [Install Allure CLI](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/#_installing_a_commandline)

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

```bash
# Navigate to the test module (e.g., core-product-tests)
cd core-product-tests

# Run runner class
mvn clean test
```

---

## 📊 Generate Allure Report

```bash
# After tests have run, generate HTML report:
Action: mvn allure:report
# Open the report in browser
mvn allure:serve
```

> ⚠️ Report will be empty unless test scenarios actually ran and generated data in `allure-results`.

## 🧾 Feature File Example

```gherkin
Feature: Core Product Tests - NBA Warriors Site

  @Jackets
  Scenario: Extract all Men’s Jackets details from the Shop
    Given I am on the Core Product Home Page
    When I navigate to the Shop Menu and select Men's section
    And I scrape all Jacket items across all pages
    Then I store Jacket price, title, and Top Seller message in a text file
```

---

## 🧩 Tips

- Attachments (like `.txt` files) are linked in Allure report under **Attachments**.
- If using tags like `@Smoke`, uncomment the `tags = "@Smoke"` section in the `TestRunner`.
